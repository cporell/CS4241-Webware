Theming:
I laid out the website to have the buttons near the top of the page. This way, the first things the user sees are the actions afforded by the website. Below it, I display the list. This is a two-columned table in which each row features the name of a movie and its poster alongside it. I feel this is a more visually appealing way to display the movie list, as though it takes up more space, the posters are more eye-grabbing and are more distinctive than a column of text.

Tech:
I set up the webpage and AJAX code so that when the user adds or deletes a movie, the form in which they performed that action is erased, and the user receives an alert saying that the movie of their choice has been added or deleted.
